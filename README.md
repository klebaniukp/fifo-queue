# Fifo Queue

## I've built a fifo queue in vanilla js with additional package (localforage)

## Class with all methods to build and manage queue [is here](fifo.js)

## How I made constructor (not how you mentioned it)
Dear Recruiter, please have in mind that I intentionally don't check if queue exists in constructor, because queue name field that is set in constructor is enough, when u try to push something to queue it will use this field and automatically create queue.
